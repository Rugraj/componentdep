# componentdep

As due to time constraints I have done System Dependency application as run via console.

User can input on console and get result back on console.

If input is like:

DEPEND   TELNET TCPIP NETCARD
DEPEND TCPIP NETCARD
DEPEND DNS TCPIP NETCARD
DEPEND  BROWSER   TCPIP  HTML
INSTALL NETCARD
INSTALL TELNET
INSTALL foo
REMOVE NETCARD
INSTALL BROWSER
INSTALL DNS
LIST
REMOVE TELNET
REMOVE NETCARD
REMOVE DNS
REMOVE NETCARD
INSTALL NETCARD
REMOVE TCPIP
REMOVE BROWSER
REMOVE TCPIP
END

The ouput at console will be:


DEPEND   TELNET TCPIP NETCARD
DEPEND TCPIP NETCARD
DEPEND DNS TCPIP NETCARD
DEPEND  BROWSER   TCPIP  HTML
INSTALL NETCARD
	NETCARD Installing
INSTALL TELNET
	TCPIP Installing
	TELNET Installing
INSTALL foo
	foo Installing
REMOVE NETCARD
	NETCARD is still needed.

	BROWSER Installing
INSTALL DNS
	DNS Installing
LIST
